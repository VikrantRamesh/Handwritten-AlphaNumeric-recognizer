# Handwritten-AlphaNumeric-Recognizer

Handwritten To Text Recognition using Tensorflow (TF) CNN model, trained on MNIST Dataset extended by data argumentation. The deep learning model recognizes individual alphabets or numbers and turns them into text with an validation accuracy of over 97%. The model functionality and accessibility is assisted by an web-application based user interface that utilizes fastapi (based on python) to fetch, predict and return the predictions to the front-end.
